minetest-australopithecus-auto-drops
====================================

A system which drops all drops from a dug node as items.


Features
--------

 * Items are "dropped" from a dug node with a random velocity in a random
   direction.
 * The mod is completely configurable from the configuration file.


Usage
-----

The system activates itself, you just need to add the mod to the subgame.


Configuration
-------------

The system can be configured by adding settings to the `minetest.conf`:

    # If the system should be activated, defaults to true.
    autodrops_activate = true
    
    # If the field should be set to disable automatically pickup provided
    # by the auto-pickup mod, defaults to false.
    autodrops_autopickup_disable = false
    
    # The value for the timeout before the auto-pickup mod is allowed to pick
    # it up, defaults to 1.
    autodrops_autopickup_timeout = 1
    
    # If the stacks that are split in some way, defaults to single.
    # Possible values are:
    #  random: The dropped stacks are split randomly.
    #  single: The dropped stacks are split into every single item.
    #  stack: The dropped stacks are dropped as they are.
    autodrops_split = single
    
    # The maximum velocity of newly dropped items, defaults to "2, 4, 2".
    autodrops_velocity = 2, 4, 2


Drop additional items
---------------------

If you want to drop additional items, in some way, you can easily do this by
invoking `autodrops.drop`, which does accept a position and a List of
ItemStacks.

    -- Invoked from somewhere.
    
    -- Check if the autodrops object is available, that allows to define it
    -- as optional dependency.
    -- Check if the autodrops system is active, that is needed to make because
    -- the user can always deactivate it from the configuration.
    if autodrops ~= nil and autodrops.active then
        -- Now drop your stacks.
        -- position is a position, a table with x, y, z values.
        -- stacks is a List if ItemStacks or item strings (or both). The List
        -- is a table extension available in the utils mod.
        autodrops.drop(position, stacks)
    else
        -- Add items directly to the inventory of the player directly.
    end


Force activation
----------------

You can also force activate the system, even if it has been disabled in
the configuration, by invoking `autodrops.activate_internal`.
